%In addition, a plan in the form of a time-tabled schedule of project activities
%and outputs will be given. This should include internal milestones as well as
%external assessments and reviews. The plan should both state progress to date
%and indicate future activities. A diagrammatic presentation of the plan is
%usually best, and there are standard techniques, such as Gantt Charts,
%which you can use. The stages of the project should be broken down into an
%appropriate level of detail, e.g., "design 5 weeks" is too vague: you need to
%indicate what tasks will go into your design and how long you expect each of
%these tasks to take.  Also included should be a risk assessment containing the

%carrying out the project; What new skills will be required and how these will be
%acquired;
