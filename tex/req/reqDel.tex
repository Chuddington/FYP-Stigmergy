%Description of anticipated documentation;
%Description of anticipated software;
\begin{itemize}
\item Blueprints and Manual for constructing the Robotic Dark Room
\item Source code for the program/s used to demonstrate the Dark Room using the
      e-Puck Hardware Platform
\end{itemize}

%Description of any anticipated experiments;
Experiments include making sure program/s run successfully on the target
platform, the robots sense light trails left in the dark room and that the
robots have behaviour based on the light trails.  The experiments can only work
once the arena is built.

%Description of methods for evaluation of the work.
The main evaluation method will be the programs written to familiarise with the
hardware platform.  By utilising a program with basic behaviour patterns, 
improvements to the structure, and algorithms for the main software, can be 
made.
