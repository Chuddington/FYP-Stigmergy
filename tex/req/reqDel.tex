%Description of anticipated documentation;
%Description of anticipated software;
\begin{itemize}
\item Blueprints and Manual for constructing the Robotic Dark Room
\item Source code for the program/s used to demonstrate the Dark Room using the
      e-Puck Hardware Platform
\end{itemize}

%Description of any anticipated experiments;
Potential experiments include making sure that the created program/s run
successfully on the e-Puck Hardware Platform, the constructed dark room allows
the robots to sense light trails left on the glowing floor and that behaviour
towards the light trails are encoded into the e-Puck platforms.  These
experiments can only be carried out once the arena is built.

%Description of methods for evaluation of the work.
The main evaluation method will be the programs written to familiarise with the
hardware platform.  By utilising a program with basic behaviour patterns, 
improvements to the structure, and algorithms for the main software, can be 
made.
