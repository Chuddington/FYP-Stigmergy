%Who the project is being done for (your supervisor, and any external customer);
The project is being completed for Professor Karl Tuyls in the
department of Computer Science, University of Liverpool, as the primary
supervisor.  The Project is also applicable for anyone wishing to build an area
in which to conduct simulations that utilise the E-Puck platform\cite{ePuckSite}

%What the aim of the project is, what it is intended to achieve;
Project Aims include building the testing grounds for the robotic simulations as
well as showing a demonstration of the arena through the use of the e-Puck
hardware platform.  With the completion of this project, researchers have the
capability of producing a testing ground for their experiments with the e-Puck
hardware platform.  To complete the demonstrative aspect of the aims
%What the proposed solution is, how the aim will be achieved.
