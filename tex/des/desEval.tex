%What criteria to evaluate system?
As mentioned earlier in the document\ref{desBaseEval}, the elements that fall
under evaluation are the dark room to be constructed and the compiled program
that will be placed on the e-Puck robotic system to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the construct as a dark room.

\begin{description}
  \item[The Dark Room] \hfill \\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The room can contain multiple robots
    \item Light level is low enough to not affect the glow in the dark flooring
    \item Being able to view the robots without leaking light into the arena
    \item Portable and flexible; easy to set up
  \end{itemize}
  \item[The Compiled Program] \hfill \\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Helps to evaluate the dark room
    \item Interacts with the light messages left on the flooring
    \item Implements the StiCo algorithm
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

%user friendliness
%users' feedback, etc.
It is difficult to evaluate how user friendly the final products will be.  This
is because the user will have minimal interaction with the robots.  The robots
will flash to indicate a change in the algorithm that will be executed.  To
construct the dark room, the user will require basic knowledge of creating
knots.

%How to assess these criteria?
%Who are involved in evaluation?
%Ethical use of Human Data & Human Participants, if any.
%What testing?
%What conclusion expected?
