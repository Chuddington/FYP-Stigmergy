# COMP390 Final Year Project
Final year project based on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence


## Project Outline
"A robotic swarm is composed of a large number of simple physical robots. From
the local interactions between the robots and the interactions of the robots
with the environment, an efficient global intelligence emerges. Multi-robot
coverage is the problem in which a swarm of robots needs to coordinate
decentralised in order to effectively and efficiently cover an unknown
environment. Examples include various monitoring, rescuing, and patrolling
scenarios. The purpose of this project is to set up an experimental
demonstrator, i.e. 'a dark room', in which multi-robot coverage experiments can
be conducted using e-puck robots, implementing the stigmergy principle as
observed in ant colonies. Ants use chemicals, called pheromones, to communicate
with each other via the environment. However, despite of a few reports of using
chemicals in robotic experiments, this is not a straightforward approach due to
difficulties in implementation and limited extendability. Therefore, we take
advantage of a glow-in- the-dark foil (i.e. a foil covered by phosphorescent
material which absorbs UV light and re-emits the absorbed light at a lower
intensity for up to several minutes after the original excitation). As robots
need to emit light to the glow-in-the-dark foil, each e-puck robot is equipped
with a UV-LED pointing toward the floor. The glowing trails will take up the
role of natural pheromones."
